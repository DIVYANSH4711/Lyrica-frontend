# üéµ Lyrica - Song Recommendation System

**Lyrica** is a machine learning-powered song recommendation system that suggests similar-category songs based on a user's selected track. Built by our team, Lyrica utilizes a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) containing metadata such as genre, mood, tempo, and other acoustic features.

The goal of this project is to help users discover new music aligned with their preferences by analyzing and comparing songs based on their characteristics. By leveraging content-based filtering techniques, Lyrica delivers accurate and relevant music recommendations.

## ‚ú® Features

- Input a song to receive similar recommendations from the dataset.
- Songs matched by genre, tempo, mood, and other features.
